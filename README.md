This folder contains three files for the Getting and Cleaning Data Project:
* **Readme.md** - this file
* **CodeBook.md** - description of the data generated by the *run_analysis.R* script
* **run_analysis.R** -  R script to unzip, select required fields and merge the data used in the project. 
	* To run this script issue the command: `source("run_analysis.R")`. 
	* You will need to have the data file *getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip* in the folder from which the command is run. The file can be obtained [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).  
	* Two data frames are initialized upon running the script (more details can be found in the codebook): 
		* *data* contains the fully merged data with all mean and standard deviation features for each data point. 
		* *summaryData* contains the mean of each feature for each activity/subject combination.
